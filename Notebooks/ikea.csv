"SEKTION / MAXIMERA Base cabinet w/3 fronts & 4 drawers - white/Bodarp gray-green 15x24x30 """,https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sektion-maximera-base-cabinet-w-3-fronts-4-drawers-white-bodarp-gray-green-s99318863/,mary b.,Ikea not what it use to be,"This review is for the Sektion 3 fronts/4 drawers. 
Like other reviews I agree the directions are not correct for where to place the drawer hardware on the frame. If it helps this is what I did.
Starting from the bottom
Drawer #1 row 2 on frame, hardware use bottom middle hole (of the 6 grid) I believe this is actually correct in the instructions
Drawer #2 row 10 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 9)
Drawer #3 row 18 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 17)
Drawer #4 row 22 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 21)

The inside drawer is flexible you could raise or lower the row you put it on. As I have above gives 3.75 inches clearance for each drawer. 

Hopes this helps.

Regarding the quality, AKURUM system Ikea used to have the downgrade in quality is obvious; fronts are cheaper the metal support strip looks terrible if eye level with drawer and the toekick just cheap - terrible",3,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,6f368bc0-b51c-5f4e-bbd2-d5d1cca61274,07/16/22

The drawer instructions are straight up incorrect. In order to get all three front-facing drawers to close, you have to install some of the drawer faces upside down, change the hole heights, and just trial and error for literally hours. 

Some of the other reviews on here are helpful, but the best piece of advice I have is to not assemble any of the drawers fully until you've put them all in and are sure they fit. So only do the bare minimum to test. Save yourself having to undo and redo a lot of work screwing in the bottom, etc. There are also helpful youtube videos for how to remove the drawer fronts using a screw driver - very easy if you actually see how the mechanism works. Ikea just needs to provide specialized instructions for both the interior drawer and how to get all three panels to fit for this specific cabinet.",4,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,6f368bc0-b51c-5f4e-bbd2-d5d1cca61274,07/16/22

Mine is induction, so no heat issues, But I am not sure if the top drawer is too close for a gas or electric coil cooktops. Drawer fronts are very expensive in my opinion.

Like other reviews I agree the directions are not correct for where to place the drawer hardware on the frame. If it helps this is what I did.
Starting from the bottom
Drawer #1 row 2 on frame, hardware use bottom middle hole (of the 6 grid) I believe this is actually correct in the instructions
Drawer #2 row 10 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 9)
Drawer #3 row 18 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 17)
Drawer #4 row 22 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 21)

The inside drawer is flexible you could raise or lower the row you put it on. As I have above gives 3.75 inches clearance for each drawer. 

Hopes this helps.

Regarding the quality, AKURUM system Ikea used to have the downgrade in quality is obvious; fronts are cheaper the metal support strip looks terrible if eye level with drawer and the toekick just cheap - terrible",3,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,826d38b0-1e3d-52b5-b488-c0a55479e269,07/16/22

The drawer instructions are straight up incorrect. In order to get all three front-facing drawers to close, you have to install some of the drawer faces upside down, change the hole heights, and just trial and error for literally hours. 

Some of the other reviews on here are helpful, but the best piece of advice I have is to not assemble any of the drawers fully until you've put them all in and are sure they fit. So only do the bare minimum to test. Save yourself having to undo and redo a lot of work screwing in the bottom, etc. There are also helpful youtube videos for how to remove the drawer fronts using a screw driver - very easy if you actually see how the mechanism works. Ikea just needs to provide specialized instructions for both the interior drawer and how to get all three panels to fit for this specific cabinet.",4,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,826d38b0-1e3d-52b5-b488-c0a55479e269,07/16/22

I just love IKEA, we have plenty of IKEA furniture in our house. I know it is not West Elm quality but neither is the price.

We did a huge kitchen with Axstad fronts last fall, 13 cabinets overall with over 20 drawers and lots of doors. We have grey base cabinets and white uppers. It is IMPOSSIBLE to keep these fronts clean. Even if you clean right away, there will be greasy stains left that are not going away. They will somehow get burned into the surface and you always see them. If you have a dark kitchen with no sunlight, these might be ok but with a sunny kitchen you will ALWAYS see stains and grease. It is disgusting. I cleaned with soap water, detergent, any product you can think of, The stains will NOT GO AWAY. Search the net and you will find plenty of complaints.

Like other reviews I agree the directions are not correct for where to place the drawer hardware on the frame. If it helps this is what I did.
Starting from the bottom
Drawer #1 row 2 on frame, hardware use bottom middle hole (of the 6 grid) I believe this is actually correct in the instructions
Drawer #2 row 10 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 9)
Drawer #3 row 18 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 17)
Drawer #4 row 22 on frame top middle hole (of the 6 grid) (Instructions say row 21)

The inside drawer is flexible you could raise or lower the row you put it on. As I have above gives 3.75 inches clearance for each drawer. 

Hopes this helps.

Regarding the quality, AKURUM system Ikea used to have the downgrade in quality is obvious; fronts are cheaper the metal support strip looks terrible if eye level with drawer and the toekick just cheap - terrible",3,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,2ea4bb4a-bf66-51d0-9ec0-5ab54cb15849,07/16/22

The drawer instructions are straight up incorrect. In order to get all three front-facing drawers to close, you have to install some of the drawer faces upside down, change the hole heights, and just trial and error for literally hours. 

Some of the other reviews on here are helpful, but the best piece of advice I have is to not assemble any of the drawers fully until you've put them all in and are sure they fit. So only do the bare minimum to test. Save yourself having to undo and redo a lot of work screwing in the bottom, etc. There are also helpful youtube videos for how to remove the drawer fronts using a screw driver - very easy if you actually see how the mechanism works. Ikea just needs to provide specialized instructions for both the interior drawer and how to get all three panels to fit for this specific cabinet.",4,4.1,IKEA,ikea.com,2ea4bb4a-bf66-51d0-9ec0-5ab54cb15849,07/16/22

We decided to purchase this couch again last year because of how comfortable and beautiful the first one was. We were really sad to find out that the newer version is much less comfortable (the seat cushions are too stiff and the pillows seem like they are a different density than before). The bottom of the couch also used to have a cross support piece that is absent on the new version which allows the new version to sag more. Despite all this disappointment we are keeping the couch since the back pillows are adjustable which is nice when changing seating positions and we plan on adding 3"" upholstery foam to the seats to improve seated comfort.

More than enough for two people to lay down and two big dogs. The fabric is sensitive to cat nails, but haven't had any issues with the dogs ripping the fabric.
